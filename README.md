# Netflix-Clone (Still in Progress)
Clone of the Netflix page and site I have bgun working on. Allows for title selections and displays info of the movie to the user as does the Netflix site.

(8/20) Latest changes I have made is adding more depth to the site, simplifying many of the functions by importing/exporting the required functions and variables between pages to minimize the code, added some responsize design (not great, but beginning), and have made many changes in the clone's layout design {STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS THOUGH}.

I have so far been using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery but want to create a database for the movies and link the files using Node.JS and MySQL.
